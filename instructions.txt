Go to line 874 of the trader.py
If you dont know where that is just find a text block like this in the code and just type the rules after this block of comments:
"
                # This is where you can add your own rules
                # if you uncomment the line of code that is below this text you can make some rules for the bot
                # So the first line where it says potion_results["attack"], it means that if you have attack in your
                # Inventory do this:
                # Then it does a transaction, I will tell you what all the arguments do in the transaction(arguments)
                # The first argument is potion_results, you dont need to know what that does, it just needs to be there
                # The next argument is cnt which is also another thing that needs to be there
                # The next is "defense" which means that if the other people has defense in their inventory
                # The next is 1 which means how many defenses are being traded
                # So if 1 defense is being traded by the other party then do this
                # The next is "attack" which is what your character will choose to trade
                # The next is 1, so the bot trades 1 attack for 1 defense
"
After you have found that you can now create your own rules.
Heres an example of adding a rule where the bot sells 1 life for 2 def:
cnt["def"] in the if statement makes sure that the person trading you has selected def

A rule that you need to know. When you place this rule make sure that it is in line with all the other code
else it will give errors.

if not outputcheck and cnt["defense"]:
    print("ITS THIS15")
    # len(potion_results["life"]) >= 1 is saying that if you have 1 or more life in your inventory do this
    if len(potion_results["life"]) >= 1:
        # dont worry about the (potion_resulst, cnt) part
        # "life" is there because it is that item that you want to sell
        # After that comes 1 which means you sell only 1 of it (life)
        # Then comes defense because thats what you want to buy
        # Then comes 2 that is how much of it you want. So you want 2 defenses

        output = transaction(potion_results, cnt, "life", 1, "defense", 2)
    # You dont need to care about what happens in these if statements
    if output:
        print("Successful Transaction")
        outputcheck = True

    if outputcheck:
        extracheck = False
