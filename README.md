## Description 

La_La_Composer is a Machine Learning composer trained with large midi datasets to create its own kind of music. GAN technology is
used to make this possible. The music that comes out of the program will be heavily inspired by the midi data that the program has been given.

The GAN model is being trained on images that have been made out of midi's. In turn the GAN model will make images similar to the images given by the user.
The next plan is to be able to decrypt the images that the GAN will output and turn them into music.

#### Technologies 

- Python 3.6

## How To Use 

Run the program with this command, after downloading all packages
```
python main.py
```

#### Prerequistites 

You must have node installed with the right versions specified in the technologies part.
